Powerful knowledge base using plain text Markdown files (for note-taking & project management)

Note-taking is incredibly personal. Tried every app, but something always irks you? You deserve better.
For those who can't custom-build a solution for themselves, Obsidian is as close as you can get, with plugins, themes, and custom CSS at your disposal. 

With Obsidian, your data sits in a local folder. Never leave your life's work held hostage in the cloud again.
